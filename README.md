STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) decomposition is a widely-used method in time series analysis to decompose time series data into three components: Trend, Seasonal, and Residual.

This lib can decompose time series using STL in each gird/pixel.

In addition, it includes the Tukey method for detecting anomalies.

I have also defined functions so that the result can be exported as an image.

In test, I used the 2016 Beijing traffic dataset DeepST for the example.
